# Replication package of the paper: Smells in System User Interactive Tests

This repository contains the necessary scripts and data required to generate the figures and tables present in the paper: Smells in System User Interactive Tests. In this document we describe each script and the prerequisite required to execute them.

## 1. Run Ikora Smells

### 1.1. Prerequisite

* Java 8 or later
* Maven 3.6.0 or later
* Jar of [Ikora Evolution](https://github.com/UL-SnT-Serval/ikora-evolution)

### 1.2. run-smell-detector.sh

* **Description**: A bash script that is reading all the configurations available under *data/configurations* to execute the smell detector

* **Arguments**: The absolute path to the jar file of ikora-evolution

* **Output**: For each json file contained in *data/configurations*, the script generates two csv files containing information about (1) the project that is analyzed and (2) data about the smells present in each Robot Framework test.

## 2. Generate the figures and tables

Python script used to analyze and draw the data generated for the paper. Note that none of the scripts described in this section contain arguments. Futhermore, all the figures from all the scripts are save to the *figures* repository and the table are saved to the *tables* repository in the form of latex tables.

### 2.1. Prerequisite

We recommend to use a dedicate `virtualenv` to run the python scripts as they contain quite a large amount of dependencies.

* Python 3.8 or later
* install the dependencies with: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 2.2. inialize.py

* **Description**: A python script that unzip all the data that are provided in order to avoid to rerunning

### 2.3. projects.py

* **Description**: A python script that plots information about the projects such as the number of lines, the number of tests, keywords, commits, etc. 

### 2.4. smells_selection.py

* **Description**: This script extract the information contained in the file *data/smells_catalog.xlsx* and plot them. Notably the figures present in RQ1 of the paper are generated by this script.

### 2.5. smells.py

* **Description**: A python script that plots figures and generate tables about the smells present in the projects. Notably, all the tables and figures present in RQ2 and RQ3 of the paper are generated by this script.

### 2.6. clean.py

* **Description**: A python script that removes all the files extracted from the archives as well as the cache files in order to be able to start from a clean environment in case of corruption or if one wants to switch between the strategy presented in section 1.2 and 2.2 to generate the data.

### 2.7. utils scripts

* **Description**: Two python scripts are written to support the activities of the other scripts and cannot be called directly, namely, `graphics.py` and `data.py`.
